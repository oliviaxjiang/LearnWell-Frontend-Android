### Introduction

LearnWell is a tutoring app where users can sign up as either tutors or tutees and submit posts containing their needs, skills, and availability. This app functions as a forum for tutees to find a suitable tutor, and vice versa.

### Main Page

A splash screen containing the app name will be displayed as the app is launching. Once the app is launched, it will open to the home page, where the user can browse through a scrollable list of posts from tutors and tutees. Each post contains the user’s username at the top, the title and contents for the actual post, the relevant course, and the availability of the user. The post will also indicate at the top whether the user is seeking a tutor or a tutee. This home page also contains a search bar; if the user types a specific keyword in the search bar, then the list of posts displayed will be filtered to just those containing that keyword (e.g. searching for a specific class).

### Add New Post

The user also has the ability to add a new post, which they can access by clicking the add button on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen. This interface has a place for the user to enter their post title, post content, relevant course, and their availability. There is also a toggle switch for the user to indicate if they are looking for a tutor or a tutee. Clicking the “Post it!” button at the bottom of the screen will upload the post to the Cloud API and to the top of the home screen of scrollable posts. If the user wishes to return to the main screen without submitting a new post, they can press the back icon at the top left corner.

### User Profile, Registration, and Login

By clicking the user button on the menu bar, the user can navigate their profile containing their user information. This includes a photo, their name, their need, their current courses, and their previously taken courses. By clicking the “Create an account” button at the top of the screen, the user is sent to a registration page. On this page, they can fill out their name, need, current courses, and past courses, and register by clicking the register button at the bottom. If they wish to return to the user page without registering, they can click the back icon at the top left of the screen. The user page also contains a button to log in; if the user clicks this, they will be sent to a page where they can input their username and password. Once again, they can log in by clicking the log in button, or they can return to the user page by clicking the back icon.
